# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Shared HTTP client helpers in `nebula-common` (`proxy` / `control_plane` / `health` / `audit` presets).
- Comma-separated `ETCD_ENDPOINT` multi-address support for HA clients.
- HA topology: `docker-compose.ha.yml`, `deploy/ha/Caddyfile.*`, `scripts/phase_d_ha_drill.sh`.
- Phase D bare-metal HA drill report: `docs/dev/ha/report-20260711.md`.
- Observability dual-write: `nebula_common::DualWriteEmitter` (Prometheus local + xtrace `push_metrics` on Gateway/Router hot path).
- W3C TraceContext propagator in `init_tracing`; JSON log path docs for Loki (`docs/dev/loki.md`, `deploy/observe/promtail-nebula.yaml`).

### Changed
- BFF v2 handlers are thin envelopes; shared logic lives in `service` (metrics parse, migrate, cache, errors).
- `nebula-observe` uses common telemetry and aligned `OBSERVE_*` env conventions.
- CI documents full-workspace test gate (`cargo test --workspace --all-targets`).
- Architecture / optimization docs: N4-Obs is current mainline; production etcd 3-node deferred.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Node multi-replica reconcile keyed by `(model_uid, replica_id)`, with periodic full reconcile to advance Drain/orphan cleanup.
- Scheduler scale-down when healthy replicas exceed desired (`select_replicas_to_remove`).
- Endpoint recovery budget (24h / 5 attempts + backoff → `Failed`) and process-group cleanup on local restart.
- Meta `list_prefix_snapshot` and Router per-model `plan_version` filtering (snapshot-revision watch).
- Cancel/SSE contract script: `scripts/test_cancel_sse.sh`.
- Docs layout: `docs/arch/`, `docs/dev/`, `docs/manual/` with index at `docs/README.md`.

### Fixed
- Scheduler reconcile panic when replica bounds had `min > max` (orphan empty placement).
- Node refreshes endpoint `plan_version` after placement version bumps so Router keeps accepting remaining replicas.

### Changed
- Architecture and sprint plan docs rewritten around correctness (multi-replica / scale-in / Drain) before recovery and performance.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- Reorganized project structure: moved test and debug scripts from root to `scripts/`.
- Renamed long documentation filenames to more concise alternatives.
- Configured `etcd` in `bin/nebula-up.sh` to use a temporary data directory (`/tmp/nebula-etcd`) instead of the project root.

### Added
- Added `AGENTS.md` to define project organization rules for AI agents and developers.

## [2026-02-15]

### Added
- Added full frontend i18n infrastructure via `frontend/src/lib/i18n.tsx` with locale persistence and interpolation support.
- Added Chinese/English language switch entry in the account menu and default locale bootstrap to Chinese.
- Added `docs/i18n_acceptance_checklist.md` for end-to-end bilingual QA and regression checks.

### Changed
- Migrated major frontend views and dialogs to translation keys, including Dashboard, Models, Inference, Catalog/Library, Templates/Images, Login, Settings, Profile, and Account pages.
- Updated app bootstrap to wrap `App` with `I18nProvider` in `frontend/src/main.tsx`.
- Expanded i18n dictionaries to cover all currently referenced frontend translation keys in both `zh` and `en`.

### Changed
- Updated `bin/nebula-up.sh` with xtrace preflight validation to fail fast when `OBSERVE_AUTH_MODE=service` but `OBSERVE_TOKEN` is empty.

### Added
- Added a deployment checklist for preventing recurrent `{"message":"Unauthorized"}` on `/api/audit-logs`.
- Added remote runbook troubleshooting steps to auto-sync `OBSERVE_TOKEN` from `~/github/xtrace/.env` and verify audit API health.

### Fixed
- Fixed a common operational misconfiguration where missing `deploy/nebula.env` or empty `OBSERVE_TOKEN` caused Audit Logs to fail intermittently after restart.

## [2026-02-14]

### Added
- Added explicit BFF xtrace auth mode with `OBSERVE_AUTH_MODE` (`service` / `internal`).
- Added `crates/nebula-bff/Dockerfile` for containerized BFF builds.
- Added optional `xtrace` service under Docker Compose profile `observe`.
- Added deployment guidance for BFF + xtrace auth strategy in docs.

### Changed
- Updated BFF xtrace proxy behavior to use explicit mode policy instead of caller-token fallback.
- Updated local startup scripts to support BFF startup and xtrace mode configuration.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include BFF service and route Gateway to BFF.
- Updated deployment and README docs with dev/prod recommended auth settings.

### Fixed
- Fixed Audit Logs Unauthorized behavior by clarifying and enforcing service/internal auth configuration paths.
